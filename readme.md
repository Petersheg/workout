The purpose of the App is to make users track any workout of their choice either Runing or Cycling.

### APP OPERATION AND FUNCTIONALITIES

    #Add workout
        User can click on the Map to add information about a specific workout using a form.

    # Logg Workouts
        This information will be logged to sidebar for easy tracking.

    # Logg Marker on Map
        A marker will appear on the Map to indicate where the user start the workout from.

    # Move Map to a particular workout
        When there are many workouts, and User can actually detect which belongs to which info logged at the sidebar, then user can click on the inforamtion on the sidebar to move the map to that particular marker.

I will work to improve the functionality such as

1) Edit and Delete a particular workout.
2) sort workout base on particular input.
3) Get an API to return workout address instead of using coordinates.
4) Prolly indicate the distance of the workout from the source to destination on the map with a line.
